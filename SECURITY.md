## Reporting a Vulnerability

The primary security concern for this project is the potential for malicious links, phishing sites, or scams being shared within the community.

If you discover a security vulnerability (e.g., a malicious link posted in an issue, a phishing site pretending to be us, or a vulnerability in the website's code itself), please report it privately.

**Do NOT open a public issue.**

Instead, please send an email to: [YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS]

Please include as much detail as possible:
*   The nature of the vulnerability (e.g., "Malicious link in issue #42").
*   The URL(s) involved.
*   Any other relevant information.

We will investigate all reports and take appropriate action, which may include removing the content and banning the user responsible.
